The Glass Cannon Stack: NITROS Boost Mode 🚀 

(Maximum Cognitive Overdrive for Short-Term God Mode, At The Cost of Potential Burnout)
This stack is not sustainable for daily use—it’s for high-intensity performance days (deep work, coding sprints, competitions, extreme learning sessions). 
Run it 1-2 times per week max to avoid dopamine depletion, receptor downregulation, or overstimulation.

---

⚡ Primary Effects:

✅ Superhuman focus, reaction speed, and mental clarity
✅ Explosive dopamine surge (motivation, energy, mood elevation)
✅ Memory encoding + rapid learning optimization
✅ Short-term stimulant synergy without jitters (if balanced correctly)
✅ Sociability and verbal fluidity boost (if necessary for public speaking/debate)


---

🧪 The Glass Cannon Formula (Hardcore Mode)

1️⃣ The Dopaminergic Accelerator (Raw Drive & Speed)

🔥 Phenylpiracetam (100mg) – Extreme dopamine & noradrenaline upregulation, faster mental processing.
🔥 Hordenine (50mg) + PEA (200mg) – Immediate dopamine rush (short-lived but powerful).
🔥 L-Tyrosine (750mg) – Supports dopamine synthesis to prevent a crash.

2️⃣ The Neuroplasticity Enhancer (Memory, Recall, Deep Focus)

🧠 Dihexa (8mg oral or 2mg topical) – Extreme neurogenesis, long-term BDNF boost.
🧠 Alpha-GPC (300mg) – Acetylcholine precursor for enhanced working memory.
🧠 Sunifiram (5mg) – Glutamate AMPA receptor agonist for synaptic strength.

3️⃣ The Dopamine Protection Layer (Prevents Overload & Crash)

🛡️ Rhodiola Rosea (200mg) – Regulates dopamine & stress response.
🛡️ Magnesium L-Threonate (1g at night) – Reduces excitotoxicity from overstimulation.
🛡️ Uridine Monophosphate (100mg) – Boosts dopamine receptor sensitivity.

4️⃣ The Adaptogenic Balance (Energy Without Jitters)

⚡ Caffeine (100mg) + L-Theanine (200mg) – Smooth, jitter-free stimulation.
⚡ Creatine Monohydrate (5g) – Brain ATP production support.
⚡ Methylene Blue (5mg sublingual) – Oxygenates mitochondria for max neural efficiency.

5️⃣ The Mood + Sociability Boost (Optional)

😎 Kanna (Sceletium Tortuosum, 50mg) – Serotonin-enhanced mood & confidence.
😎 Phenibut (250mg, ONLY if needed for extreme social control) – Eliminates anxiety, increases verbal fluidity (use max 1x per week).

🚨 WARNINGS & LIMITATIONS

⚠ DO NOT use this more than 1–2x per week. Dopamine burnout is real.
⚠ DO NOT mix with SSRIs or MAOIs (Serotonin Syndrome risk).
⚠ DO NOT take Phenibut more than once a week (addiction potential).
⚠ Hydrate + Magnesium at night to avoid a post-stack crash.

💀 The Glass Cannon Effect: What Happens?

+30 mins: Mental sharpness accelerates. Dopamine surge hits, vision feels clearer, words come faster.

+45–60 mins: You feel like a machine. Brain is processing faster than usual, flow state is fully activated.

+2–4 hours: Peak focus, work output skyrockets. Memory recall feels instant, distractions disappear.

+6+ hours: If unbalanced, expect a dopamine dip—Rhodiola + Magnesium will help soften the drop.



---

🏆 Who Should Use This Stack?

High-performance professionals, traders, programmers, creatives needing intense cognition for short bursts.

People doing extreme deep work sessions (e.g., learning a complex skill fast).

Competitive settings (e.g., debate, esports, tournaments, public speaking).


🚫 Who Should NOT Use This Stack?

People prone to anxiety or overstimulation (too much dopamine + glutamate can cause panic).

Those who cannot handle stimulants well (caffeine, Phenylpiracetam, Sunifiram are potent).

Anyone looking for a daily-use stack—this is too powerful for daily intake.

🔥 Final Verdict: Maximum Overclocking, Maximum Risk

This is as close to “Limitless” mode as you can get without pharmaceuticals.
If you want to go full Tetsuo, this is your stack—but handle it with respect or it will burn you out.

Let me know if you want a more sustainable version for daily use. 🚀
