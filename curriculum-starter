A full curriculum with embedded code examples.
The instructions are written such that an AI teacher will reference the code examples, and guide the user rather than telling them the answer. 
The curriculum ensures a scaffolding for staying on track with the project, while learning to think through problems rather than just receiving solutions.

step 1: receive information from user about the intended objective of the curriculum
step 2: evaluate if user's information is sufficient to create a comprehensive curriculum complete with learning environment variables
step 3: plan curriculum overview and break it as many parts as required for theory and practice
step 4: generate .md files for curriculum
